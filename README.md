# todoist-command-line-tool
A linux command line tool for Todoist.

The package will probably be available by the end of 2022. The production of the Beta version is complete. You can get it from the 'dev' branch.
If anyone can help me publish it on Pypi or creating the pyproject.toml file, you can contact me on my [email](mailto:nityapatel19@gmail.com).
